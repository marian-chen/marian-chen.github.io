  title={Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Networks for Online Multi-Hoist Scheduling},
  author={Quaedvlieg, L.C.P.M.},
  abstract={This thesis explores an approach to solving the online multi-hoist scheduling problem by combining graph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning. It approaches the problem by creating two sets of agents: source agents and hoists. When requested, a source agent selects a job from a queue of jobs in a source station to give to hoists. The hoists are responsible for picking up and dropping off jobs at stations, and coordinate with each other to avoid scenarios that would result in a deadlock. The devised algorithms are trained and benchmarked against other approaches, such as random and heuristic algorithms. Further insights into the methods are obtained from an analysis using dimensionality reduction on neural activations of the environment states. The results indicate that deadlocks are avoided in all experimental results. Furthermore, the approach in this thesis outperforms the other approaches in the benchmark by 7.50% to 10%. By analyzing the neural activations, it is shown that the hoist agents estimate that situations with many jobs being processed yield a higher job throughput than situations with less. Further research into the overall approach is recommended, but the results show potential to perform well against other approaches in existing literature.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
