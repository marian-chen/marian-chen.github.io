Welcome to my website! I am currently in my final year of the [BSc Data Science & Artificial Intelligence](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence)
degree program at Maastricht University, where I am on track for the highest distinctions, an endeavor for which is underscored by my recognition as a recipient of the [Nutanix Advancing Women in Technology Scholarship](https://www.nutanix.com/scholarships).


Beyond my degree program, I am highly committed to broadening my field of expertise. As an intern of the Research & Development 
department at [Aucos AG](https://www.aucos.de/en/home-2/), I am working on an optimization project centered around 
**constraint programming**. Furthermore, I recently completed the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Advanced Applications of Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning) 
program with a grade of A+ at Lady Margaret Hall, [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). During this program, I
cultivated theoretical and practical expertise of foundational concepts in **generative models**, **reinforcement learning**,
and **graph neural networks**. Specifically, however, my fields of interests revolve around combinatorial optimization problems,
graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning. For more information about my past projects, please feel free to check
out my [Research Projects](/projects/) page!


Outside of academia, I am passionate about leveraging my skills to create positive impacts in my community, having served two
years as the student council chair and representative for 3,200 students on the Faculty Board alongside the Dean 
and Director at the [Faculty of Science & Engineering](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-science-and-engineering).
Furthermore, I co-founded and served as the internal commissioner of the [Science & Engineering Association Limburg](https://fse-seal.nl/),
a faculty-wide study association dedicated to enriching students' academic, professional, and social experiences.


Away from a computer screen, you can find me testing new recipes from different countries, binging geography and history
channels, or learning a new language (currently fluent in English, Mandarin, Spanish, German, and Swiss German)!


Thank you for visiting my website. I encourage you to reach out (see the bottom of this page) if you have any opportunities
for partnership or simply want to connect!
