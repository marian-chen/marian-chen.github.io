Welcome to my personal website 👋! I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/),
where I also do research at the [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/).
My current research 🔬 revolves around **graph neural networks**, **reinforcement learning**, and **self-supervised learning** 
for combinatorial optimization problems. Prior to my master's degree, I completed a BSc in Data Science and Artificial 
Intelligence 🎓 at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence).

During my bachelor's studies, I had the opportunity to delve into applied research in various areas. As an AI research 
intern at Aucos AG, I worked on projects involving **multi-camera multi-object tracking**, and **multi-agent systems**.

My primary research interests lie within the exciting fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a 
particular emphasis on reinforcement learning and multi-task learning. For more in-depth information about my work, feel
free to explore the [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

Additionally, I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to create positive impact and make a difference in 
people's lives 🌍💡. I believe in the power of collaboration, innovation, and entrepreneurship to drive meaningful 
change 🤝. Through my involvement in various associations, hackathons, and initiatives, I have gained invaluable 
experience in addressing real-world challenges and contributing to sustainability efforts ♻. I am excited about 
opportunities to further expand my horizons and contribute to projects that align with this ideology 🚀.

When I'm not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me skiing down slopes ⛷, exploring scenic hiking 
trails 🥾🏞️, or participating in field hockey 🏑. 

Thank you for visiting my personal website. I welcome collaboration and invite you to reach out (see the bottom of this
page), whether you have ideas for impactful projects, opportunities for partnership, or simply want to connect!
