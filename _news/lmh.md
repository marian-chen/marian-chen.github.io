I am pleased to announce that I have completed the three-week Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Advanced
Applications of Neural Networks and Deep Learning program at the [University of Oxford](https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning)!
In this program, I became proficient in theoretical and practical applications of generative AI, reinforcement learning,
and graph neural networks.
