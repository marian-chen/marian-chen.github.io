This is my first official group project, which was completed in Fall 2020 for the Project 1-1 course at my bachelor's [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/courses-curriculum)
at Maastricht University. 

## Phase 1: The 2-Dimensional Knapsack Problem

Initially, we focussed on the 2-dimensional knapsack problem. Given the
shapes of pentominoes, the goal was to see if they could be used to create a perfect fit on a grid of any size. We
implemented the dancing links algorithm, invented by Donald Knuth, to do efficient planning for this problem. The result
is shown in the GIF below.

## Phase 2: Pentris

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/phase2.gif" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        In the second phase of the project we decided to learn about different planning algorithms and genetic algorithms to
        learn how to play a game of Tetris with pentominoes! We also learned how to use JavaFX, save and load high scores,
        and even include music in the game. You can see the final product on the left!

## Phase 3: Optimizing for the Bounded 3D Knapsack Problem

Finally, we decided to apply our knowledge from the previous two phases in order to develop software that is able to
optimally pack parcels into a 3-dimensional container. We developed 6 types of parcels of different sizes, for which
the user is able to fill in their amounts and values. The goal of the algorithm is to fill the container with parcels
such that the cumulative value is maximized. We used genetic algorithms and modified the 2-dimensional version of the
dancing links algorithm to 3-dimensional space, and made it work with incomplete solutions. The final result can be seen
in the video below!
