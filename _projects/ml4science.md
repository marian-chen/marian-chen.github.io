This [ML4Science](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/ml4science/) project was completed for the [CS-433 Machine Learning](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/machine-learning-cs-433/) course
taught at EPFL in Fall 2022. We are generously hosted by [Volvo Group Trucks Technology](https://www.volvogroup.com/en/) 
and [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) to work on this project.

In recent years, autonomous vehicles have garnered significant attention due to their potential to improve the safety, 
efficiency, and accessibility of transportation. One important aspect of autonomous driving is the ability to make 
lane-changing decisions, which requires the vehicle to predict the intentions and behaviors of other road users and to 
evaluate the safety and feasibility of different actions.

In this project, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) architecture combined with reinforcement learning (RL) and a 
model predictive controller to solve the problem of autonomous lane changing. By using GNNs, it is possible to learn a 
control policy that takes into account the complex and dynamic relationships between the vehicles, rather than just 
considering local features or patterns. More specifically, we employ Deep Q-learning with Graph Attention Networks for 
the agent.

The final report for this project is embedded below. It focuses on the most important points but does not exhaustively
cover everything done in the project. For more information on the project implementations, visit the GitHub repository
linked above.

Here are some keypoint of the project:

- Autonomous Lane Changing
- [Deep Q-Learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236)
- [Dynamic Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491)
- Model Predictive Controller

The main finding from this project is that overall we have demonstrated the potential usage of deep RL with GNNs for 
automating lane-changing decisions. Thus, further training the model for more episodes could likely improve performance. 
However, we also noticed a strong bias in the algorithm towards certain actions, likely because the traditional 
experience replay mechanism tend to learn bias from imbalanced data. Improving the model architecture and environment
will likely lead to better agents.
