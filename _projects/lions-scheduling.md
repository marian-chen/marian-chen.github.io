title: Skill-Based Job Allocation Optimization in Hospitals using Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Networks
authors: Lars. C.P.M. Quaedvlieg
description: This project uses graph neural networks to exploit the natural graph representation of the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem. Combined with deep reinforcement learning, high-quality priority dispatching rules are learned

I am happy to share I have joined the [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/)
to work on a research project during the Spring 2023 semester. My work, supervised by [Grigorios Chrysos](https://people.epfl.ch/grigorios.chrysos)
and [Stratis Skoulakis](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/people/postdocs/efstratios-stratis-skoulakis/), will be on the
use of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning for scheduling problems. More specifically, we will focus on the
most well-known industrial problem: the [Job-Shop Scheduling Problem](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Job_shop_scheduling#:~:text=The%20Job%2DShop%20Scheduling%20Problem,needed%20to%20complete%20all%20activities.).

The project has been started on **November 25th 2022**. If you are interested in its progression, regularly check this
