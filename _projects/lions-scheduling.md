I am happy to share that, for this research project, I joined the [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/) 
during the Spring 2023 semester. My work, supervised by [Grigorios Chrysos](https://people.epfl.ch/grigorios.chrysos)
and [Stratis Skoulakis](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/people/postdocs/efstratios-stratis-skoulakis/), is on the
use of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning for scheduling problems. More specifically, we will focus on a job
assignment problem for hospitals.

Efficient job allocation is a critical factor in various domains such as healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing, as
it optimizes resource utilization and ensures timely task completion. This report introduces and investigates the Job 
Allocation Problem (JAP), which involves assigning a maximum number of jobs to available resources while considering
multiple constraints. 

The contributions of this project are twofold. Firstly, it showcases the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in overcoming the 
challenges posed by annotated data requirements, providing a practical and scalable approach to job allocation. By
directly learning from simulations, the model demonstrates the ability to allocate jobs effectively without extensive
manual labeling, thus enhancing efficiency.

Secondly, the utilization of GNNs allows the model to leverage the inherent graph structure of the JAP. This approach 
builds upon previous research where GNNs have shown promising results in solving combinatorial optimization problems. 

Experimental evaluations conducted on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. The model's superior performance over baseline algorithms highlights its potential for enhancing job 
allocation in various domains. Furthermore, out-of-distribution testing reveals the model's generalizability, 
showcasing its ability to handle diverse scenarios beyond the training data.

The final report has been embedded below. It goes into detail about the problem, our approach, other related research,
and experiments.
